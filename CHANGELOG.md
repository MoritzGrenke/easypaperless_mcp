# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

#### Document History
- `get_document_history` — retrieve the full audit log for a document, returning a paginated `ListResult[AuditLogEntry]`. Each entry records the timestamp, action type (`create`/`update`), a `changes` dict of before/after values, and the actor who performed the action. Supports `page` and `page_size` for pagination. Requires easypaperless ≥ 0.6.0.

#### Infrastructure
- `PAPERLESS_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` env var (server-side, optional): maximum retry count after the first failure. Set to a positive integer to enable automatic retries for transient errors. Default: disabled (0).
- `PAPERLESS_RETRY_BACKOFF` env var (server-side, optional): initial sleep in seconds between retry attempts, doubling exponentially on each subsequent attempt. Example: `PAPERLESS_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3` with `PAPERLESS_RETRY_BACKOFF=2.0` retries at 2 s, 4 s, 8 s. Default: 1.0 (library default, only relevant when attempts > 0). Invalid values raise `RuntimeError` at startup.
- Bumped `easypaperless` dependency to `>=0.6.0`.

### Changed

#### Documents (Breaking)
- `list_documents` items no longer contain keys for omitted fields — fields excluded via `return_fields` are now entirely absent from each item dict instead of being present as `null` or a zero value. Callers that relied on the full document shape being present (with nulls for unselected fields) must update their handling.
- `get_document` response no longer contains keys for omitted fields — same behaviour as above for the single-document endpoint.
- `list_documents` and `get_document` — `omitted_fields` now contains **only field name strings**. The retrieval hint is no longer appended as the last element of the list. Callers that read the final element of `omitted_fields` as the hint must switch to the new `omitted_fields_hint` field.

#### Documents (Additive)
- `list_documents` — `ListResult` now includes `omitted_fields` (field names excluded by `return_fields`) and `omitted_fields_hint` (retrieval hint string, non-empty when fields are omitted). Both empty when all fields are included.
- `get_document` — response dict now includes `omitted_fields` and `omitted_fields_hint` under the same conditions.
- `update_document` — new `add_tags` and `remove_tags` parameters for incremental tag changes without knowing the document's current tag list. Both accept IDs or names (strings are resolved via the tags API). Mutually exclusive with the existing `tags` parameter.
- `update_document` — new `return_fields: list[str] | None` parameter. Defaults to a smart set containing `id`, `modified`, and every field explicitly provided in the call. Explicit `return_fields` overrides the default entirely; `id` is always included. Response is now a filtered dict instead of the full `Document` model, with `omitted_fields` and `omitted_fields_hint` metadata following the same contract as `get_document`.

### Fixed

- `update_document` — the existing `tags` docstring now prominently warns that it **overwrites all existing tags** and recommends `add_tags` / `remove_tags` for incremental changes.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added

#### Users
- `list_users` — list with username filtering, ordering, and pagination.
- `get_user` — fetch a single user by ID.
- `create_user` — create a user account with optional email, password, name, role flags, and group/permission assignments.
- `update_user` — PATCH semantics; pass `None` to clear nullable fields.
- `delete_user` — permanently delete a user account.

#### Trash
- `list_trash` — list all documents currently in the trash with pagination.
- `restore_trash` — restore one or more trashed documents back to active status.
- `empty_trash` — permanently and irreversibly delete specific documents from the trash.

#### Security
- Client-side authentication: `PAPERLESS_TOKEN` is now resolved per request from the MCP client (env var for stdio, HTTP headers for HTTP transport). The token is never read from the server environment.
- HTTP transport now accepts `Authorization: Bearer <token>` as the preferred auth header; `X-Paperless-Token` continues to work but is deprecated — a warning is logged when used.
- If both `Authorization: Bearer` and `X-Paperless-Token` are present, `Authorization: Bearer` takes precedence.
- `PAPERLESS_URL` can optionally be locked server-side (Docker); if not set, each client supplies it via `X-Paperless-URL` header.
- `CredentialMiddleware` injected into the FastMCP server to handle per-request credential resolution.

### Infrastructure
- RC release workflow added to GitHub Actions.
- Stable release workflow excludes pre-release tags.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-19

Initial release of easypaperless-mcp.

### Added

#### Documents
- `list_documents` — list with full filtering coverage (search, tags, correspondents, document types, storage paths, custom fields, date ranges, ASN, checksum, pagination, ordering). Compact default field set (`id`, `title`, `created`, `search_hit`) to keep token usage low; customisable via `return_fields`.

- `get_document_metadata` — fetch file-level technical metadata (checksums, MIME type, page count, embedded PDF tags).

- `delete_document` — permanently delete a single document.
- `upload_document` — upload a file; `wait=True` polls until processing completes and returns the Document.
- `bulk_add_tag` / `bulk_remove_tag` — add or remove a single tag across many documents.
- `bulk_modify_tags` — atomically add and/or remove tags across many documents.

#### Infrastructure

- GitHub Actions CI/CD release workflow.
- `ListResult[T]` response wrapper with `count` (total matches in paperless-ngx) and `items` for all `list_*` tools.
- `_filter_fields` helper ensures `return_fields` filtering never sets required fields to `None` (uses type-appropriate zero values instead).
- Singleton `SyncPaperlessClient` via `get_client()`.
